            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps to make</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.<br> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds,<br> Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to<br> 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg,<br> remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
            <br>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.<br> Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.<br> Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers,<br> and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.<br> Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
